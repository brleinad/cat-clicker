# Cat Clicker

This is a project to practice design patterns in javascript.
It consists of a simple game where the user has different cats and by clicking on a cat a counter is incremented. 

The application itself is simple but I try to use an MVC approach to make it as scalable and maintanable as possible. It's mainly an exercise for 'best practices'.
